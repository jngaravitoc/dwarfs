Dwarf galaxies problems:

Ultra Faint Dwarfs : $10^2-10^5 M_{\odot}$

Dwarfs as a test of Galaxy formation models, these galaxies are the most senstive to feedback processes
and disruption of their baryons, e.g Leo T (High in HI and with recent star formation), how this galaxy retains its HI gas?
Is DM is massive enough to help the gas inside the galaxy see (MJ17).

To compare the effect of the environment e.g feedback processes it is important to compare field and satellite dwarf galaxies.

1). Internal tructure (Cusp/Core problem)
2) Missing Satellite Problem
3) Constrains to Reionization
4) Testing Galaxy Formation models.
